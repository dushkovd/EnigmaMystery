🔍 CLUES

🧪 ROUND 1: CRIME SCENE EVIDENCE

Shattered glass has residue of sedatives + rare herbal compound.

Zaynep’s keycard is missing.

Torn journal page: “He thinks I’m scared — I’ve seen worse monsters.”

A to-do list: “Talk to Ayla. Final warning.”

Security footage glitch: 30-minute blackout reported earlier by Marco.

🔍 ROUND 2: INTERROGATION ROUND I

Felix’s prescription pad has a missing page—no corresponding dose administered on record.

Ayla’s locker contains the missing keycard and a snapped wine opener.

Marco’s passport shows conflicting country stamps—Zaynep noted “don’t make me escalate this” in her notes.

Talia’s donation site was accessed from the in-flight Wi-Fi after the time of death.

Crew recorder note: “Some passengers think they own the skies... but I won’t be silenced.”

🔍 ROUND 3: INTERROGATION ROUND II

A syringe cap was found under seat 7B — Felix’s assigned seat — but several passengers switched seats during turbulence.

Witness saw Marco stash a pouch in a galley bin. Contents not identified.

Ayla overheard crying in the lavatory: “I didn’t think she’d actually go through with it.”

Deleted footage partially recovered from Talia’s feed shows a flight uniform entering crew quarters — face not visible.

Zaynep’s digital calendar: “Felix – must settle this before it’s too late.” But there are unsent messages to both Ayla and Marco.

🔓 FINAL REVEAL: THE KILLER — DR. FELIX MOREAU

MOTIVE:

Zaynep recognized Felix from his past media scandal and confronted him. She had identified a past patient of his who died mysteriously — a connection that threatened to expose his unlicensed activities and destroy his comeback. Her journal and calendar confirm escalating tension.

MEANS:

Felix brought an illicit sedative compound, disguised in an insulin pen. He knew Zaynep had a habit of relaxing with a drink post-takeoff and laced her beverage with the compound — lethal only in combination with alcohol.

OPPORTUNITY:

He used the crew keycard stolen from Ayla’s locker and slipped into the crew area during the power flicker Marco had earlier reported. Wearing a backup flight uniform taken from the supply closet, he bypassed suspicion. The camera blackout and altered schedule covered his movements.

✅ Why He’s the Only One Who Could Have Done It:

Only Felix had the technical knowledge and access to the specific sedative compound.

The syringe cap links to non-commercial medication.

The calendar and voice notes place Zaynep in direct conflict with him.

Other suspects had motives, but lacked the ability or timing to carry out the poisoning.

The uniform disguise, timing of the blackout, and missing keycard all point to careful planning — within Felix’s capability.
