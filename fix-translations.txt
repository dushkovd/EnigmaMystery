FIX FOR HARDCODED TRANSLATIONS IN AuthForm.tsx

The following lines need to be changed in src/components/AuthForm.tsx:

LINE 455 (around line 455):
CHANGE FROM:
        By signing up I accept the <a href="/terms" className="underline text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">terms and conditions</a> of this page.

CHANGE TO:
        {t('auth.termsAccept')} <a href="/terms" className="underline text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">{t('auth.termsAndConditions')}</a> {t('auth.termsOfThisPage')}

LINE 477 (around line 477):
CHANGE FROM:
          Already have an account? Sign in here.

CHANGE TO:
          {t('auth.alreadyHaveAccount')} {t('auth.signInHere')}

After making these changes:
1. Save the file
2. Commit: git add src/components/AuthForm.tsx && git commit -m "Fix hardcoded translations"
3. Push: git push origin develop
4. Wait for GitHub Actions deployment to complete
5. Test on staging environment
